# bingorino

## What is it?
This is a small project I made for me and my friend, inspired by the [EldenBingo](https://github.com/awsker/EldenBingo) project. It's a program originally made for TF2 bingo battles.

## Requirements
[.NET Runtime 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

The program needs an "objectives" folder with a "objectives.txt" file to work. Without the text file, exe doesn't even boot up.

## Keybinds
Left Mouse Button: Mark square as blue

Right Mouse Button: Mark square as red

Left Alt + Left Mouse Button: Unmark square
